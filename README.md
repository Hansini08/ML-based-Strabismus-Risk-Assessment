# ML Based Strabismus Risk Assessment System

## 📖 Project Overview
This project presents a Machine Learning based system for automated risk assessment of Strabismus. The system integrates facial image analysis using a CNN-based model and structured clinical questionnaire data using Logistic Regression to provide reliable risk prediction.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Strabismus (eye misalignment) requires early detection to prevent complications such as amblyopia and vision impairment. Manual diagnosis depends on clinical expertise and may not always be accessible. This project aims to develop an AI-based screening support system for early risk assessment.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Image preprocessing (Resize, Normalization)
2. Feature extraction using MobileNetV2
3. Risk prediction using Logistic Regression (questionnaire data)
4. Score-level weighted fusion for final decision

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- Pandas, NumPy
- Flask (for deployment)

## 📊 Dataset
- Facial image dataset (Kaggle)
- Manually generated questionnaire dataset with labeled risk categories

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Real-time mobile deployment
- Larger clinical dataset integration
- Integration with hospital systems
